A real-time iris detection and tracking algorithm has been developed using LabVIEW graphical programming tools, implemented on a smart camera. This program accurately detects eyes and identifies the center of the iris, recording its coordinates in Cartesian format. Subsequently, the system computes and records the iris centerâ€™s location across consecutive video frames, generating a sequential list of coordinates. <br />

Eyeball tracking technology holds significant potential for improving the quality of life for disabled individuals. By leveraging LabVIEW for Eyeball tracing, tailored solutions can be developed to assist people with disabilities in various ways. For those with mobility impairments, Eyeball tracking systems can serve as alternative input devices, enabling hands-free interaction with computers and assistive technologies. This could include controlling wheelchairs, navigating virtual environments, or operating household appliances through gaze-based commands. Additionally, Eyeball tracking can aid in communication for individuals with speech and motor impairments, allowing them to type messages or select symbols on a screen simply by looking at them.
